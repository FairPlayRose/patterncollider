## About

Pattern Collider is a tool for exploring quasiperiodic tiling patterns. Every pattern that you create with Pattern Collider has a custom URL that you can save &share. 

Learn more by watching the Minute Physics video.

Patterns are *periodic* if they repeat themselves as you slide the pattern over in some direction. Conversely, a *nonperiodic* pattern will never repeat itself when you slide in any direciton. *Quasiperiodic patterns* are a special type of nonperiodic patterns that appear periodic when you view a small patch, but as you grow the pattern outwards you find that it never repeats itself. The most famous example of a quasiperiodic tiling is the [Penrose Tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling), but there are infinitely many examples that you can create with this tool.

Pattern Collider is based on the multigrid method of creating quasiperiodic patterns, discovered by the mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn. Here's the basic idea behind this.
