# TODO

- [x] hover and click on lines
- [x] hover and click on tiles
- [x] randomize colors button
- [x] rescale tiles slider
- [x] select colors
- [x] reset selection button
- [x] keep size constant across symmetry
- [ ] fix select bugs for offset 0
	- symmetry 6, offset 0, can't click on tile
	- symmetry 5, offset 0, clicking on 1 line creates dark green tiles
- [ ] click and drag
- [ ] download PNG button
- [ ] download SVG button
- [ ] make shareable

	- this can be accomplished by identifying tile with its area + a sorted list of the line orientations that generate it

## Optional
